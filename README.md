## Tech Stack

- Angular 15+
- Angular Material
- TypeScript, RxJS, SCSS

## Features

- **Routing & Layout**: `/tasks` route with a sidebar layout (Tasks, Users, Settings â€” only Tasks is functional).
- **List View**: Table display of tasks with:
  - Sorting by UID, Title, Status, Priority, Due Date, Assignee.
  - Pagination (5, 10, 20 items per page).
  - Text filter (search by title or requester).
  - Filter by status.
- **Detail / Edit**: Click a row to open a modal with editable fields. The same form component is used for both create and edit.

## Extensions Implemented

1.  **State management**: Angular Signals are used for reactive state management within the application. The `TaskService` utilizes signals to manage the list of tasks and users, providing a simple yet powerful way to handle data flow and updates.
2.  **Theme switcher**: Implemented a light and dark theme switcher, driven by SCSS variables (design tokens) and dynamically applied via Angular Material's theming system.
